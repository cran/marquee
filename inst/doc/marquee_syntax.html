<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Marquee Syntax</h1>



<p>This document will go over the syntax recognized by marquee, which is
largely an extension of the <a href="https://commonmark.org">CommonMark</a> spec. A cornerstone of the
markdown philosophy is that <em>any</em> text is valid markdown, and
this carries over to marquee. This means that if you make an error in
your text, you will not get an error during parsing - the output will
just not look how you expected (say, you forget to close an emphasis
you’ll simply get a wrong emphasis span). While markdown is pretty
well-known at this point, this document will go through it all and
lastly touch on the few addition to CommonMark that marquee adds.</p>
<div id="markdown-vs-commonmark" class="section level3">
<h3>Markdown vs CommonMark</h3>
<p>In the above I used two different names to discuss the syntax that
marquee adheres to. Markdown is the original specification developed by
John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004. The spec was intentionally vague
and ambiguous which led to a divergence in how different parsers handled
edge cases. CommonMark was developed to tackle this by bringing forth a
stringent and internally consistent syntax that parsers could develop up
against. On top of CommonMark, various entities have then build their
own flavour of extended syntax, most well-known perhaps is GitHub
flavoured markdown (GFM). Marquee is CommonMark compliant, meaning that
it adheres to the specific syntax interpretation that CommonMark
defined. Further, like GFM, marquee provides its own additions to the
syntax, some overlapping with other flavours, and some uniquely its
own.</p>
<p>In the following we will use the name “Markdown” to refer to the
CommonMark syntax.</p>
</div>
<div id="standard-markdown-syntax" class="section level2">
<h2>Standard Markdown syntax</h2>
<p>Markdown can be thought of as a way to naturally mark text as
belonging to various stylistic or contextual elements. It favors ease of
reading and writing in it’s raw representation over flexibility, but
does cover almost all standard needs for text formatting (this document
is written with markdown). The elements that can be marked broadly falls
into two buckets: Block elements and span elements.</p>
<div id="block-elements" class="section level3">
<h3>Block elements</h3>
<p>A block element is an element that contains some completed content,
in the sense that two following blocks are contextually separated. A
block can contain further blocks inside of it, or raw text.</p>
<div id="paragraphs-p" class="section level4">
<h4>Paragraphs (<code>p</code>)</h4>
<p>The most basic block element is a paragraph. A paragraph is any run
of text that is not another block element. Paragraphs are separated by
two consecutive line breaks.</p>
<pre><code>this is the first paragraph

this is a second one</code></pre>
<p>You can use single line breaks in a paragraph to wrap the text in the
raw format. These linebreaks are ignored when parsing. This means that
this text:</p>
<pre><code>here we add linebreaks
because we want the raw
text to have a certain
width</code></pre>
<p>is semantically similar to</p>
<pre><code>here we add linebreaks because we want the raw text to have a certain width</code></pre>
<p>If you want to force a linebreak inside your paragraph, you end the
line with two spaces and a linebreak. Be aware that some code editors
strips trailing spaces when saving the document.</p>
</div>
<div id="headers-h1-h6" class="section level4">
<h4>Headers (<code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code>)</h4>
<p>Markdown supports up to six levels of headers. They can be defined in
one of two ways:</p>
<pre><code># Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>Header 1
========

Header 2
--------</code></pre>
<p>The last style only supports level 1 and 2, but are visually more
pronounced in the raw encoding.</p>
</div>
<div id="block-quotes-bq" class="section level4">
<h4>Block quotes (<code>bq</code>)</h4>
<p>A block quote is semantically a paragraph you wish to highlight in
some way. It can contain further blocks inside of it that will all be
part of the block. It is created using email-style quoting</p>
<pre><code>&gt; This is a block quote
&gt; 
&gt; It contains two paragraphs</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="code-blocks-cb" class="section level4">
<h4>Code blocks (<code>cb</code>)</h4>
<p>A code block is intended to hold unparsed text (often code). Any
markdown inside a codeblock is ignored and shown as-is. This means that
a code block cannot contain child blocks as there is no way to specify
them. Code blocks are created by either indenting everything with 4
spaces, or enclosing text with <code>```</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>This is a paragraph

    This is a code block
    
    # This will not be converted to a header
    
new paragraph</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>This is a paragraph

```
This is a code block

# This will not be converted to a header
```
    
new paragraph</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="lists-ul-ol-and-li" class="section level4">
<h4>Lists (<code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, and <code>li</code>)</h4>
<p>Lists in markdown comes in two flavors: Unordered and ordered.
Ordered lists can be created by using either <code>*</code>,
<code>-</code>, or <code>+</code> as a bullet, and ordered by using a
number followed by either <code>.</code> or <code>)</code>. All the
styles are semantically equivalent so it is up to taste what to
choose.</p>
<pre><code>* This is an unordered list
* It has a second bullet point

1. This is an ordered list
2. next item</code></pre>
<p>Depending on whether there is an empty line between consecutive
elements the list might be considered tight or not which defines how it
is styled by the parser</p>
<pre><code># Tight
- This is
- a tight
- list

# Untight
- This is

- so untight

- I can&#39;t even</code></pre>
<p>List items can have child blocks, either multiple paragraph or other
block elements itself</p>
<pre><code>* First list item

* Second one

  This contains a second paragraph. It must be indented
  
  &gt; We could even add a block quote
  
* Third item contains a sub list

  1. let&#39;s make it ordered
  2. and tight</code></pre>
<p>Ordered lists only care about the number of the first item. The
remaining item numbers are not inspected. This means that this list</p>
<pre><code>1. item one
2. item two
3. item three</code></pre>
<p>is semantically equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>1. item one
9. item two
4. item three</code></pre>
<p>The first number, however instructs the renderer where to start the
numbering from</p>
<pre><code>5. This list starts counting from 5
6. and so on
1. This will be item 7 despite what we wrote</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="horizontal-rulers-hr" class="section level4">
<h4>Horizontal rulers (<code>hr</code>)</h4>
<p>Last of the block items are horizontal rulers. They demarcate a break
between two blocks and can be created using three or more asterisks
(<code>*</code>) or hyphens (<code>-</code>), optionally with spacing in
between, on their own line, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>* * *</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>-------------------------</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="span-elements" class="section level3">
<h3>Span elements</h3>
<p>Span elements are elements that do not break the flow of text but are
considered “inline”. The classic example is marking some text as being
emphasized (often rendered italicized). You wouldn’t expect such an
element to break into a new line, but rather to keep the flow.</p>
<div id="emphasize-em" class="section level4">
<h4>Emphasize (<code>em</code>)</h4>
<p>To add emphasis to some text, wrap it with a single asterisk
(<code>*</code>) on either side. Classic markdown also allows the use of
underscore (<code>_</code>), but in many flavors (marquee included),
this has been repurposed and thus doesn’t work.</p>
<pre><code>Within this line of text we add *emphasis* on one word</code></pre>
<p>While emphasis is often styled with italic, this is not a given and
emphasis should be considered semantic rather than stylistic.</p>
</div>
<div id="strong-str" class="section level4">
<h4>Strong (<code>str</code>)</h4>
<p>To give a part of a text more weight you can wrap it in two asterisks
on either side. Like with emphasis above, this is semantic, but often
equates to rendering the text with bold</p>
<pre><code>I&#39;m making a **strong** point here</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="link-a" class="section level4">
<h4>Link (<code>a</code>)</h4>
<p>While links are rather useless in marquee as it is intended for
raster rendering, the syntax is supported and will often result in a
slightly different (though unclickable) rendering style. Links are
created using the following syntax</p>
<pre><code>[link text](link-url)</code></pre>
<p>Links can also be created by enclosing a URL in
<code>&lt;&gt;</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link-url&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In that case the url will be used as the text as well</p>
</div>
<div id="code-code" class="section level4">
<h4>Code (<code>code</code>)</h4>
<p>Inline code, like code blocks will render its content as-is. A code
span is created by enclosing the text in a single back-tick
(<code>`</code>)</p>
<pre><code>This text has some fancy code in it `six &lt;- 1 + 5`, right?</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="images-img" class="section level4">
<h4>Images (<code>img</code>)</h4>
<p>Images are included in the text using a link-like syntax, but
prepended by an exclamation mark:</p>
<pre><code>![Image title](image-path)</code></pre>
<p>The title/alt-text is ignored by marquee for the same reasons links
are useless, but can be used to make the raw text more easy to
understand. While standard markdown expect the image path to point to a
file on the system, with marquee it can also name a graphic object in
the environment. For example, if you have created a plot with ggplot2
and saved it to the <code>p</code> variable, you can insert it into your
markdown document by simply adding</p>
<pre><code>![](p)</code></pre>
<p>While images are semantically span elements, marquee will treat
images that resides on their own line (surrounded by empty lines) as a
block element.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="markdown-extensions" class="section level2">
<h2>Markdown extensions</h2>
<p>Apart from the base syntax described above, marquee allows a few
additional features:</p>
<div id="underline-u" class="section level4">
<h4>Underline (<code>u</code>)</h4>
<p>You can underline a run of text by enclosing it with underscore. Note
that this feature means that the classic use of underscore as an alias
for asterisk when emphasizing text no longer works. Note that while
emphasis is semantic, underline is very much a stylistic mark</p>
<pre><code>We will _underline_ a word</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="strikethrough-del" class="section level4">
<h4>Strikethrough (<code>del</code>)</h4>
<p>If you want to give the appearance of something being deleted, you
can enclose it with tilde (<code>~</code>)</p>
<pre><code>I&#39;m sure this is ~good~ better</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="custom-spans" class="section level4">
<h4>Custom spans</h4>
<p>Marquee has it’s own style of custom span elements, if you need to
style a text run in a special way. It is created by enclosing the text
with <code>{.name</code> and <code>}</code>, which will give the
enclosed text the <code>name</code> style (which is up to you how to
render). Be aware that the preceding dot is removed from the span
element name. Alternatively you can use <code>{#name</code> and
<code>}</code>, which will give the enclosed text the <code>#name</code>
style (note that the hash is not stripped from the span element
name).</p>
<pre><code>Sometimes my text is so {.stylish eloquent} that the basic markdown elements are not enough</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="miscellaneous" class="section level2">
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<div id="escaping-syntax" class="section level4">
<h4>Escaping syntax</h4>
<p>As you can see from the above, a small set of characters holds
special meaning in markdown (some even holds multiple meanings). These
are: <code>\</code>, <code>`</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>_</code>,
<code>~</code>, <code>{</code>, <code>}</code>, <code>[</code>,
<code>]</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>#</code>,
<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>!</code>. Using
any of these you run the risk of your text being interpreted in ways you
did not intent. If you wish to include one of these characters as-is,
you can escape it using <code>\</code>, to instruct the parser to ignore
any formatting that may be deduced from the character.</p>
<pre><code>I just like \*asterisks\* around words</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="where-is-my-html-support" class="section level4">
<h4>Where is my HTML-support?</h4>
<p>If you are a seassoned markdown user you may be accustomed to mixing
in HTML code with your markdown text if you need to do some very
technical formatting. This works because markdown passes such code
through unaltered and if the end result is in HTML, then the included
HTML will be part of the final HTML document. However, HTML is not part
of markdown, and marquee will simply pass it through. Since the parsed
text will not be rendered into HTML it means that any HTML code you
include will be visible in it’s raw format.</p>
